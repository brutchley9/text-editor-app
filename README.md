# Text Editor Application

A useful, browser-based web application relies heavily upon a quick and responsive network driving the functionality behind it. However, if a user were to suddenly lose their own internet connection, or the application server was to lose power, would this app cease to provide its service? Client-side storage and persistent data are integral aspects of forward-thinking web development to address problems such as these.

This application is a fun and useful text editor designed to be invoked within the browser, and should also allow the user to maintain functionality in the event of network loss. Dependencies such as Express, Concurrently, Webpack, Babel, and IDB are utilized in their respective package.json files, so please take the time to understand their location and function within the file structure of this application!
